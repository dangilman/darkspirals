A python package to forward model the formation of phase-space spirals with dark and luminous galactic satellites. 

Features
--------
- generation of realistic subhalo populations, including their orbits and masses 
- flexible parameterization of the Galactic potential, and the potential of the disk in the solar neighborhood 
- approximate calculation of changes to the vertical action caused by satellite fly-bys  
- diffusion model for scattering between stars and giant molecular clouds 

Installation
--------
git clone https://github.com/dangilman/darkspirals.git; cd darkspirals; python setup.py install
