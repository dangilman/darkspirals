A python package to forward model the formation of phase-space spirals with dark and luminous galactic satellites.

Features
--------
- generation of realistic subhalo populations, including their orbits and masses
- flexible parameterization of the Galactic potential, and the potential of the disk in the solar neighborhood
- approximate calculation of changes to the vertical action caused by satellite fly-bys
- diffusion model for scattering between stars and giant molecular clouds

Installation
--------
You can install the code by cloning this repository. Navigate to where you want to store the code on your local machine and enter the following in the terminal:

git clone https://github.com/dangilman/darkspirals.git; cd darkspirals; python setup.py develop --user
