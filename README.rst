A python package to forward model the formation of phase-space spirals with dark and luminous galactic satellites. 

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://darkspirals.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------
- generate realistic subhalo populations, including their orbits and masses 
- flexible parameterization of the Galactic potential, and the potential of the disk in the solar neighborhood 
- approximate calculation of changes to the vertical action caused by satellite fly-bys
